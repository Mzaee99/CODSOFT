# Define the chatbot's rules and responses
rules = {
    "hello": "Hello! How can I help you?",
    "how are you": "I'm just a chatbot, but I'm here to assist you. What can I do for you?",
    "goodbye": "Goodbye! Have a great day!",
    "name": "I am a chatbot. You can call me ChatGPT.",
    "default_response": "I'm not sure how to respond to that. Can you please rephrase your question?"
}

# Main chat loop
while True:
    user_input = input("You: ").lower()  # Get user input and convert it to lowercase
    response = rules.get(user_input, rules["default_response"])  # Check if user input matches any rule

    print("Chatbot:", response)  # Display the chatbot's response

HERE'S HOW THE CHATBOT WOULD WORK:
You: Hello
Chatbot: Hello! How can I help you?

You: How are you?
Chatbot: I'm just a chatbot, but I'm here to assist you. What can I do for you?

You: What's your name?
Chatbot: I am a chatbot. You can call me ChatGPT.

You: What's the weather like today?
Chatbot: I'm not sure how to respond to that. Can you please rephrase your question?

You: Goodbye
Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a great day!

**EXAMPLE 2 (PA)**

# Define the rules and responses
rules = {
    'hi': 'Hello!',
    'how are you': 'I am good, thank you!',
    'bye': 'Goodbye!'
}

# Function to get the response based on user input
def get_response(user_input):
    for rule, response in rules.items():
        if rule in user_input:
            return response
    return "I'm sorry, I don't understand."

# Main loop to interact with the chatbot
while True:
    user_input = input("User: ")
    if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
        break
    response = get_response(user_input.lower())
    print("Chatbot:", response)
